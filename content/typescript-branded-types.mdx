In TypeScript, a branded type is a way to create more specific types by adding an additional layer of type safety. It allows you to differentiate between types that are structurally identical but conceptually different by "branding" one or more of them with a unique identifier. This branding does not affect the runtime behavior but provides additional compile-time safety, preventing accidental misuse of the types.

I'll explain further with an example. Consider the code below:

```typescript
const isEmailAddress = (email: string) => {
  const emailRegexp = new RegExp(
    /^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$/
  )

  return emailRegexp.test(email)
}

const handleSignUp = (email: string) => {
  // validate email
  if (!isEmailAddress(email)) {
    throw new Error(`${email} is not a valid email address`)
  }

  // Send welcome email
}
```

The drawbacks of this approach is that, 1. with this type of validation, we're forced to write an <Code>if</Code> block anywhere we use our validation functions, such as the above <Code>isEmailAddress</Code>. And 2. as far as the TypeScript complier is concerned, our <Code>email</Code> variable is just a plain <Code>string</Code>. Let me show you how we can make this implementation cleaner using TypeScript Branded types.

First, lets create our generic <Code>Brand</Code> utility type.

```typescript
type Brand<T> = T & { readonly __brand: unique symbol }
```

Here we are accepting our base type as an argument <Code>T</Code> and attaching an arbitrary object to it, which does affect the runtime behaviour of our variables at all.

Now that we have our <Code>Brand</Code> type let's go ahead and use it to create our branded email address type like below.

```typescript
type EmailAddress = Brand<string>
```

This is what you'll see when you hover over the <Code>EmailAddress</Code> type in VS Code.

<MDXImage
  alt="email address type peak"
  src="/blog/typescript-branded-types/email-address-type.png"
  width="400px"
  height="110px"
/>

Looks a bit weird, but we won't have to worry about the attached object at all when we need to work with our branded types. The <Code>readonly brand: unique symbol</Code> part is the branding mechanism. The unique symbol ensures that each brand is unique and can't be confused with others.

Next, lets create our <Code>sendWelcomeEmail</Code> function that take an argument of type <Code>EmailAddress</Code>.

```typescript
const sendWelcomeEmail = (email: EmailAddress) => {
  // Send welcome email to a valid email address
}
```

The nice thing here is that this function no longer needs to worry about validating the email that's passed to it, since by this point we'll have already taken care of that.

If you now use this function within our <Code>handleSignUp</Code> function, you'll see a TypeScript error that says <Code>Argument of type 'string' is not assignable to parameter of type 'EmailAddress'.</Code> and that's expected for now, since we haven't really told TypeScript how to determine whether our <Code>email</Code> variable is really of type <Code>EmailAddress</Code> or not.

To fix this issue, all we have to do is make our <Code>isEmailAddress</Code> function a "type guard" by adding <Code>: email is EmailAddress</Code> return type to it. See below:

```typescript
const isEmailAddress = (email: string): email is EmailAddress => {
  const emailRegexp = new RegExp(
    /^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$/
  )

  return emailRegexp.test(email)
}
```

By specifying <Code>email is EmailAddress</Code> as the return type of this function, we're telling the typescript compiler that if this function returns <Code>true</Code>, the email argument must be of type <Code>EmailAddress</Code>!

Cool! Now we have a type-safe way of making sure that a string is a valid email address. But let's make this implementation even cleaner. We can get rid of that repetitive <Code>if</Code> block when working with the branded type.

To do that, we'll create an assertion function that abstracts away that part of the logic for us.

```typescript
function assertEmailAddress(email: string): asserts email is EmailAddress {
  if (!isEmailAddress(email)) {
    throw new Error(`${email} is not a valid email address`)
  }
}
```

Just a quick note: TypeScript doesn't support using arrow functions for assertions, so we'll need to use a regular function here.

Now, we can use our new <Code>assertEmailAddress</Code> function to tidy up our <Code>handleSignUp</Code> function.

```typescript
const handleSignUp = (email: string) => {
  // Assert email address
  assertEmailAddress(email)

  // Send welcome email
  sendWelcomeEmail(email)
}
```

And that's it! This was a quick look at how you can use TypeScript Branded types. If you've used this pattern before, let me know what cool use cases you've come across. And how I can improve my implementation.

The final state of the code:

```typescript
type Brand<T> = T & { readonly __brand: unique symbol }

type EmailAddress = Brand<string>

const isEmailAddress = (email: string): email is EmailAddress => {
  const emailRegexp = new RegExp(
    /^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$/
  )

  return emailRegexp.test(email)
}

const sendWelcomeEmail = (email: EmailAddress) => {
  // Send welcome email to a valid email address
}

function assertEmailAddress(email: string): asserts email is EmailAddress {
  if (!isEmailAddress(email)) {
    throw new Error(`${email} is not a valid email address`)
  }
}

const handleSignUp = (email: string) => {
  // Assert email address
  assertEmailAddress(email)

  // Send welcome email
  sendWelcomeEmail(email)
}
```
